# Blink Detection

A real-time facial recognition program to track blinkrate.

## Description

This Python-based program tracks an individuals blinkrate through either a live-video on something like a webcam, or from a pre-recorded video. The program will open a dialog window to show the video being 
presented while a counter tracks the number of blinks in the top right, and displays green "Blink Detected" text whenever the program detects a blink. Note: This program is best used when the face is in full view infront of 
the camera and the face is well lit.
